# VS Code Custom Document Model Editor Extension

## How to run:
- Clone this repo and go to file and select option to open folder. 
- Make sure you npm i. You'll know if you didn't. 
- After this, you can hit F5 to compile the extension and run it, or alternatively, 
there should be a button down on the bottom status bar that does the same thing. 
- Now create a workspace in the newly opened instance of VS Code and name it whatever you like. Alternatively, select the option to open a folder and open an empty one. 
- The planned structure will be a yaml config in the root folder, a models folder, and a view folder. 
- Create a new file with an extension of .tchmdv in the views folder, then open it and you should be greeted by the editor. 
- You can test adding and deleting nodes and look at their associted post messages in the developer tools by opening the command palette (ctrl-shift-p), then calling Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools.
